# Python101ForHackers
Notes from the TCM Course "Python 101 for Hackers"

Target Audience: Jr Operators or anyone looking to learn more about the python language and how it can be used in hacking.

These notes are primarily for my own knowledge retention as I work through the course. If you see anything in here you can use
please feel free to do so.

There is a very liberal use of comment tags througout the modules. I am using the comment tags in this situation as more of a
note take aparatus. 

The comments follow along with the dialogue of the instructor and should help to explain what is going on
in the actual syntax.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
